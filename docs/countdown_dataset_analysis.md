## Solution Complexity Analysis

### Operation Complexity Distribution
| Operations | Count | Percentage | Description |
|------------|-------|------------|-------------|
| 0 operations | 17,567 | 3.6% | Trivial (target in number list) |
| 1 operation | 33,422 | 6.8% | Single arithmetic step |
| 2 operations | 255,533 | 52.1% | Two arithmetic steps |
| 3 operations | 183,842 | 37.5% | Three arithmetic steps |

**Key Insight**: 89.6% of problems require 2+ operations, indicating substantial multi-step reasoning requirements.

### Solution Type Classification
| Type | Count | Percentage | Description |
|------|-------|------------|-------------|
| Simple | 261,152 | 53.3% | No parentheses needed |
| Complex | 211,645 | 43.2% | Requires parentheses/precedence |
| Trivial | 17,567 | 3.6% | Target already in numbers |

### Number Utilization
| Numbers Used | Count | Percentage | Average per Category |
|--------------|-------|------------|---------------------|
| 1 number | 16,340 | 3.3% | Trivial cases |
| 2 numbers | 31,212 | 6.4% | Simple combinations |
| 3 numbers | 255,887 | 52.2% | Most common |
| 4 numbers | 186,925 | 38.1% | Maximum complexity |

**Average numbers used per solution**: 3.25 out of 4 available

## Mathematical Properties

### Operation Count vs Number Usage Relationship
- **0 operations**: Always use 1 number (trivial cases)
- **1 operation**: Typically use 2 numbers
- **2 operations**: Mix of 3-4 numbers
- **3 operations**: **Always use all 4 numbers** (100% verified)

### Why 3-Operation Solutions Use All Numbers
The mathematical constraint is elegant:
- Start with 4 numbers
- Each operation combines 2 values into 1
- Pattern: 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 (final result)
- Therefore, 3 operations are needed and sufficient to use all 4 numbers

### Complexity Metrics
- **Average operations per solution**: 2.24
- **Average numbers used per solution**: 3.25
- **Multi-step reasoning**: 89.6% of problems
- **Complex expressions**: 43.2% require parentheses

    split="train",
    create_splits=True,  # Automatic train/test splitting
    test_size=128,       # Fixed test size
    split_seed=42        # Reproducible splits

### Data Format
Problems are converted to conversation format:
```python
{
    "prompt": [
        {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT},
        {"role": "user", "content": problem_text}
    ],
    "target": target_number,
    "nums": available_numbers,
    "reference_answer": str(target_number)
}
```

### Expected Model Output
Models should generate responses in the format:
```
<think>
Step-by-step reasoning process...
To reach 94 using [15, 9, 25, 51]:
1. First, I'll divide 51 by 15 to get 3.4
2. Then multiply 25 by 3.4 to get 85
3. Finally, add 9 to get 94
</think>

<answer>
9 + 25 * (51 / 15) = 94
</answer>
```
